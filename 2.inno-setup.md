### **How Inno Setup Works**

1. **Script-Based Configuration**:
   - The behavior of the installer is defined in a script file (`.iss`), which contains instructions for tasks such as file copying, registry editing, and wizard customization.

2. **Compilation**:
   - The `.iss` script is compiled using the Inno Setup Compiler, which generates the installer executable.

3. **Execution**:
   - The installer executable is distributed to end-users, who can run it to install the application on their Windows machines.

### **Creating a Simple Installer**

1. **Step 1: Open Inno Setup**:
   - Launch the Inno Setup Compiler.

2. **Step 2: Use the Wizard**:
   - The wizard simplifies creating an installer by asking basic questions:
     - Application name, version, and publisher.
     - Installation directory.
     - Files to include.
     - Shortcut creation options.

3. **Step 3: Compile the Script**:
   - Review and customize the generated `.iss` script as needed, then compile it to produce the installer.

4. **Step 4: Test the Installer**:
   - Run the generated installer on a test machine to verify its functionality.
