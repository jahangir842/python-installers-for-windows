## **Introduction**
Creating installers for Python GUI applications can be complex, especially when dealing with dependencies, file structures, and Windows-specific requirements. This repository simplifies the process by providing detailed instructions, examples, and reusable configurations.

---

## **Prerequisites**
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+ (with `pip` and `virtualenv`)
- A Windows development environment (Windows 10/11 recommended)
- Admin rights to install packaging tools

---

## **Packaging Process**
### **1. Preparing the Application**
- Organize your Python project with a clear directory structure.
- Ensure all dependencies are listed in a `requirements.txt` file.

### **2. Using PyInstaller**
Run the following command to generate an executable:
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed app.py
```
This creates a single `.exe` file for your application.

### **3. Creating an Installer**
Use Inno Setup to create a professional installer:
1. Install Inno Setup.
2. Write a `.iss` script for your project.
3. Compile the script to generate the installer.
