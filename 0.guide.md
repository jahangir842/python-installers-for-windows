Here’s a **detailed guide** on how to use your **Windows PC as a GitLab Runner** to build a `.exe` file and a Windows installer for a Python application. This guide uses a **Windows machine** as a runner with a **shell executor** to run CI/CD pipelines in GitLab.

---

### **Pre-requisites**
1. **Windows PC**: This will serve as your GitLab Runner.
2. **GitLab Project**: The project with your Python application code.
3. **Python Environment**: Python should be installed on your machine.
4. **Tools for Building**:
   - **PyInstaller**: To convert your Python app into a Windows `.exe`.
   - **NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System)**: To create a Windows installer.

### **Step 1: Install GitLab Runner on Your Windows PC**

#### 1.1 **Download GitLab Runner for Windows**
- Go to the [GitLab Runner download page](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/windows.html).
- Download the appropriate GitLab Runner binary for your Windows version.

#### 1.2 **Install GitLab Runner**
- Open PowerShell (as Administrator) and install the GitLab Runner using the following commands:
  ```powershell
  # Navigate to the folder where the downloaded binary is located
  cd C:\path\to\downloaded\file
  .\gitlab-runner.exe install
  .\gitlab-runner.exe start
  ```

#### 1.3 **Register the Runner**
To register the runner with your GitLab project, follow these steps:
- Run the following command in PowerShell:
  ```powershell
  .\gitlab-runner.exe register
  ```
- You’ll be prompted for several details:
  - **GitLab instance URL** (e.g., `https://gitlab.com`).
  - **Registration Token**: You can find this in your GitLab project under **Settings > CI/CD** > **Runners** > **Set up a specific Runner for this project**.
  - **Description**: A name for your runner (e.g., "Windows PC Runner").
  - **Executor**: Choose `shell` for the Windows environment.
  - **Tags**: You can add tags (e.g., `dev-pc`) to identify the runner in your `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

### **Step 2: Set Up Python and Required Tools**

#### 2.1 **Install Python and PyInstaller**
1. Ensure that **Python** is installed on your Windows PC. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install **PyInstaller** to create the `.exe` file:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

#### 2.2 **Install NSIS for Installer Creation**
NSIS is a free tool for creating Windows installers. Install it from the [NSIS website](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download). Ensure that the NSIS binary (`makensis`) is added to your system `PATH`.

---

### **Step 3: Configure `.gitlab-ci.yml` to Build `.exe` and Installer**

Create or modify the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your GitLab project repository to define the steps needed to build the `.exe` file and create the Windows installer.

Here’s an example of a simple `.gitlab-ci.yml` file for this process:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - package

# Build the .exe file from Python source code
build_exe:
  stage: build
  tags:
    - dev-pc
  script:
    - echo "Installing dependencies..."
    - python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    - pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install your project's dependencies
    - echo "Building .exe file using PyInstaller..."
    - pyinstaller --onefile my_app.py  # Replace `my_app.py` with your entry script
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/*.exe  # Path to the generated .exe file
    expire_in: 1 week

# Package the .exe into a Windows installer using NSIS
create_installer:
  stage: package
  tags:
    - dev-pc
  script:
    - echo "Creating installer..."
    - makensis installer_script.nsi  # Replace with your NSIS script
  dependencies:
    - build_exe  # Ensures the .exe is built before creating the installer
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - output/installer.exe  # Path to the generated installer
    expire_in: 1 week
```

### **Explanation of the Pipeline Stages**:
1. **build_exe**: 
   - This stage installs the required dependencies, uses PyInstaller to create a `.exe` file from your Python code, and stores the `.exe` file as an artifact.
2. **create_installer**: 
   - This stage runs NSIS (`makensis`) to create a Windows installer (`.exe`) using the generated `.exe` file from the previous step.

---

### **Step 4: Write an NSIS Script for Creating the Installer**

You need an NSIS script (`installer_script.nsi`) that will package your `.exe` into a Windows installer. Here's a basic example of an NSIS script:

```nsi
!define PRODUCT_NAME "MyApp"
!define PRODUCT_VERSION "1.0"
!define INSTALLER_NAME "MyAppInstaller.exe"
!define EXE_NAME "my_app.exe"  # Replace with your actual exe file name

OutFile "${INSTALLER_NAME}"
InstallDir "$PROGRAMFILES64\${PRODUCT_NAME}"
Page directory
Page instfiles

Section "Install"
    SetOutPath $INSTDIR
    File /oname=${EXE_NAME} "dist\my_app.exe"  # Replace with the correct path to your exe
    CreateShortcut "$DESKTOP\${PRODUCT_NAME}.lnk" "$INSTDIR\${EXE_NAME}"
SectionEnd
```

#### Key Elements:
- **OutFile**: Specifies the name of the installer.
- **InstallDir**: Defines the installation directory.
- **File**: Specifies the file to include in the installer (the `.exe`).
- **CreateShortcut**: Creates a shortcut for the installed app on the desktop.

### **Step 5: Test the Pipeline**

After setting everything up, test the pipeline by pushing your changes to the GitLab repository. The runner on your Windows PC should pick up the job and execute the `.exe` building and installer creation process.

---

### **Step 6: Restrict Runner Usage to Trusted Projects**

To ensure that your Windows PC GitLab Runner is only used for specific, trusted projects (and not for public repositories), follow these steps:

#### 6.1 **Use Tags**
Ensure your runner is tagged properly during registration. For example:
```powershell
gitlab-runner register --tag-list "dev-pc"
```

In the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, you restrict jobs to only run on this runner by specifying the `dev-pc` tag:
```yaml
build_exe:
  stage: build
  tags:
    - dev-pc
  script:
    - # your build commands
```

#### 6.2 **Disable Shared Runners**
If you want to avoid using shared runners:
1. Go to **Project Settings** → **CI/CD** → **Runners**.
2. Disable **shared runners** under **Runners activated for this project**.

This ensures that your private runner is the only one used.

---

### **Conclusion**

By following this guide, you can use your **Windows PC** as a GitLab Runner to build a Python `.exe` file and a Windows installer in a pipeline. This process involves setting up GitLab Runner, installing necessary tools like PyInstaller and NSIS, and configuring your `.gitlab-ci.yml` to automate the build and packaging process.

This approach gives you the flexibility to handle Windows-specific builds directly from your developer machine, and with proper runner configuration, you can ensure it is secure and used only by trusted projects.
